                <h2>My Background <small>so far</small></h2>
                <p style="font-family:verdana;font-weight:bold;color:blueviolet;">
                    <b>In 2015</b>, <strong>I</strong> learned LaTex to submit my physics report.
                    Hyunggil has also worked in mental health facility and in Medical/Surgical Floor in hospitals.
                    I wondered if all the tools used in patient's room can become wireless... <br>
                    <em><mark>In December 2021, I started designing a software that can improve the workflow for
                        Nursing Assistants and Registered Nurses. I am excited about how that project unfolds.</mark></em>

                    <b>Hyunggil</b> also enjoys spending time in nature.
                    In <i>Washington State,</i> I enjoyed catching clams during low-tide.
                    From scraping the surface for clams, I learned which habitat do Manilla clams thrive the most.
                    <br>
                    I also enjoy hiking on Hurricane Ridge and sometimes at Camp Muir in Mt. Rainier.

    <h2>Leader Interview Project</h2>
    <p>
        I got interested in a vision called Ocean Providence growing up in my church. The vision can be summarized as if
        people want to achieve world peace, the solution lays in the ocean.

        <b>In 2019</b> a friend told me about Aquabyte, <i>a start-up company</i> that wants to increase the scale of industrial ocean
        fish farming with the use of artificial intelligence, software, and machine learning

        With encouragement from Isabella, I reached out to the company's website and set up an informational interview with <b>Rishabh Malviya.</b>
        Rishabh is a Machine Learning Platform Engineer at Aquabyte. Below are his answers to my questions.
    </p>
<h3>Conversation with Rishabh</h3>

<br>
<p>
    Question 1: How did you get to work as a machine learning platorform engineer at Aquabyte?
</p>

<p>
    "I was studying physics at my university and was involed with deep learning in the student robotics team.
    I got interested in deep learning, then I studied machine learning."
</p>

<p>
    Question 2: When did you start working for Aquabyte, and why did you want to work at this company?
</p>

<p>
    "I wanted to use my software engineering skills so that I can bring substantial impact to others. As you said, I
    felt that Aquabyte wants to help people by increasing the availability of fish for consumption."
