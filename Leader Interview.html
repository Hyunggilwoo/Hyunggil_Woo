                <h2>Dialogue</h2>
                <p>
                    I scheduled an interview with Rishabh via LinkedIn. Below is the dialogue I had with Rishabh.
                    Let me know if the dialogue piqued your interest in majoring in Computer Science or learn Machine-Learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hyunggil (H):</strong>  Good afternoon Rishabh. Thank you for meeting with me today. How are you doing?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Rishabh (R):</strong> I am doing well, thank you. How can I help you today?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> I was interested in learning about Aquabyte because it is a start-up in the ocean.
                    I reached out to Bryton Shang, Ellen Hekemere, and you. I could not find an email for Ellen.
                    I have been interested in if there is a way to achieve the Ocean Providence.
                    I heard from a young age that sustaining world peace is only possible via utilizing the food and natural minerals
                    laying in the ocean… hmm… should I continue talking?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> Yes, please continue. I am still listening.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> One project that can help the world is building international highway that
                    connects between the Easternmost Russia and the Westernmost Alaska. This bridge of some form will
                    connect between Eurasia and American continents. Another one is creating an underwater cities.
                    I thought if our society would need it not because the climate change is eroding the landmass,
                    but because living closer in contact with the marine life could be a dream for everyone.
                    Have you heard of a Japanese anime called One-Piece?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> (smiling) I heard of it from my friends. Go on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> A group of young pirates travel to an underwater kingdom built by mermaids.
                    Somehow, the kingdom has some magical barrier that allows the underwater people to walk and live
                    as if they lived on the ground. The kingdom also receives sunlight in some form as well.
                    How these people can live in close contact with nature inspired me.
                    I am not sure if a real city can be developed under the water, but if people set strong
                    standard to not pollute the environment and take care of the marine life, then people should
                    envision creating an underwater city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> I see. Those are all great ideas. I caution you that pollution happens
                    when people build cities. That is a critical problem that you need to address before constructing
                    the city. The international peace highway system will also have pollution problems as well.
                    That is an important problem you have to solve before even constructing the highway system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> You are correct. Right now, I have not researched on ways to manage
                    pollution when we build the cities. I have a thought for the international peace highway.
                    There is a project to build a Japan-Korea Undersea Tunnel. The tunnel is connecting under the sea.
                    I would imagine that a cleaning system is in place to clean up waste that accrues on a highway.
                    Even when there is a waste that leaks from the highway, my hope is that it will be contained
                    within the highway system under the ground, without exposing the waste to the open water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> I see. That is good idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> Do you mind sharing with me what interested you to work as a machine-learning
                    platform engineer?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> I majored in physics at my university. I involved myself in the Robotics team,
                    then I became interested in software engineering and artificial intelligence. Now I work as a
                    <strong> ML Engineer</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> Can you tell me what machine learning is?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> We can make a program and a machine to receive and interpret data collected
                    from some things. As a machine-learning platform engineer, I help the program decide what
                    information can change the program behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> I see. Machine learning sounds fascinating. Thank you for sharing me that
                    information. At Aquabyte, do you communicate with Bryton Shang, the CEO of Aquabyte?
                    I would imagine that there are many code in the software to maintain. Do you and Bryton fix
                    similar problems at the company?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> I only work on few programs at the company. I believe Bryton works
                    on more problems at the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> Do you mind sharing what interested you to work for Aquabyte?
                    Did you share the same vision as Aquabyte’s?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> I began searching for a job in 2020, during the pandemic. I did not want to
                    work for an Ad-tech (advertisement technology). I also wanted to use the current technology to
                    help the society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another interesting area in technology is with Ag-tech (Agricultural technology).
                    Drones fly above the crop to monitor how well the crops grow. That is another field for you to
                    check out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> <em>While working as a machine learning platform engineer, what challenges do
                    you face?</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> Learning how to use machine learning takes time. The machine learning is a
                    growing field, so the yesterday's machine learning can become outdated very soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> <em>Do you have advice for a beginning software-engineers if they want to
                    specialize in machine-learning?</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> You need to get an internship to gain experience. I hope you learn
                    new programming languages and tools to become a good software-engineer. Also, I would gain
                    some breadth in the CS field before deciding on a specialty field. You should solve mathe problems
                    to sharpen your skills as well to become a proficient machine-learning engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to start a start-up, you also need to gain funding by venture capitalists.
                    You need to network with investors as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> I see. Are you also working remotely?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> I am.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> Do you look forward to working in the office again?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> I do look forward to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> Right now, you are working at Aquabyte. In the next 5 years, do you see yourself
                    still working at Aquabyte, or somewhere else?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> I am not sure. As the Pragmatic Programmer book says, software engineers can
                    negotiate which company to work and how they work at the company. Besides, helping
                    Aquabyte achieve its goal, I am not sure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>H:</strong> Well, thank you for your time today. I appreciate your advice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>R:</strong> Thank you. Best of luck to you, man.
                </p>
